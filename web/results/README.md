### Working notes on managing results


#### Flow

1. Teams submit their outputs in a file `output.txt`.
2. `output.txt` is processed by the metrics calculator, generating a `metrics.json`.
3. `metrics.json` is added to this folder (web/results), and is processed by the results framework to populate the tables.
