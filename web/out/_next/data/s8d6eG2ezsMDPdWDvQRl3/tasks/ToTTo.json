The task is as follows: Given a Wikipedia table with row names, column names and table cells, with a subset of cells highlighted, generate a natural language description for the highlighted part of the table . The table need not be exactly rectangular in that - cells can sometimes be multi-row or multi-column.</p>\n<p>An earlier example of a Table-to-Text NLG task is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07771\">Wikibio</a> - here the inputs were Wikipedia infoboxes (from the top right corner of entity-related Wiki pages). In contrast, ToTTo mostly has Wikipedia tables from the main article content itself. In general, Table-To-Text NLG tasks can be seen as a subclass of Data-To-Text NLG tasks - where the task is to generate natural language descriptions of inputs which are in the form of structured or semi-structured data. In general, all Data-To-Text NLG tasks need not have an explicit table or other structure - e.g the input in <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-6626.pdf\">WebNLG</a> is simply a list of triples.</p>\n<p>Importantly, ToTTo differs from earlier examples of Table-To-Text NLG in that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It does not suffer from the problem of divergent references - where ground truth descriptions themselves have additional information not found in the table. ToTTo overcomes this by having a multi-step annotation process to edit the initial, free-form table descriptions (which are from Wikipedia) to make them faithful, unambiguous and independent of article context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since it provides <strong>control</strong> in the form of highlighted table cells, it prevents the problem of there being a large number of valid descriptions focussing on different parts of the table.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"why-is-this-dataset-part-of-gem\">Why is this dataset part of GEM?</h3>\n<p>ToTTo is one of the two datasets representing Table-to-Text NLG in GEM, the other one being <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02871.pdf\">DART</a>. Unlike DART, which combines datasets from multiple sources and furnishes them in a unified setting, ToTTo is from a homogeneous source. As explained in the Task Summary above, it also has an annotation process explicitly crafted to reduce divergent descriptions, which is not true of DART.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, ToTTo is also an instance of a <strong>controlled</strong> generation task - where in addition to the input (in this case the table) an additional <strong>control</strong> (in this case the highlighted cells) is given as an additional goal for the generation. The DART task formulation does not include controls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"languages\">Languages</h3>\n<p>ToTTo examples are English only (BCP-47: <code>en</code>).\nSome amounts of what may be called non-English text, including characters such as French accents or Cyrillic characters, could sometimes occur, especially through fields with entity names as values in the input table cells.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meta-information\">Meta Information</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dataset-curators\">Dataset Curators</h3>\n<p>This dataset was curated by a team of researchers from Google Research and Georgia Tech.</p>\n<h3 id=\"licensing-information\">Licensing Information</h3>\n<p>As mentioned in the <code>README.md</code> on the <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/totto\">ToTTo Main Repo</a>, this dataset is shared under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">Creative Commons Share-Alike 3.0</a> license.</p>\n<h3 id=\"citation-information\">Citation Information</h3>\n<pre><code>article{parikh2020totto,\n  title={ToTTo: A Controlled Table-To-Text Generation Dataset},\n  author={Parikh, Ankur P and Wang, Xuezhi and Gehrmann, Sebastian and Faruqui, Manaal and Dhingra, Bhuwan and Yang, Diyi and Das, Dipanjan},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14373},\n  year={2020}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"leaderboard\">Leaderboard</h3>\n<p>This dataset has an associated, active <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/totto#leaderboard\">leaderboard</a> maintained by the authors.\nThe test set ground truth targets / references are private, i.e they are not publicly shared or downloadable - hence, leaderboard submission is necessary for test set evaluation.\nTo evaluate your model on the dev or test set AND/OR submit to the leaderboard, you need to submit your model files through this <a href=\"https://forms.gle/AcF9TRqWrPhPzztt7\">form</a> (The form provides an option to opt-out of going on the leaderboard).</p>\n<p>The leaderboard reports three sets of BLEU, PARENT and BLEURT scores for each submission - on the overall test set, the <em>Overlap</em> subset of the test set and the <em>non-Overlap</em> subset of the test set.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dataset-structure\">Dataset Structure</h2>\n<p>Since the original repo <code>README.md</code> nicely illustrates the dataset structure, we largely reproduce their examples to explain the dataset structure (with some small modifications).

(see the start of Section 4 for the heuristics used)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To prevent an overlap with the earlier <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07771\">Wikibio</a>  dataset which focussed on Infobox-first sentence pairs from Wikipedia biography articles, the authors avoid using Infoboxes as a data source.</p>\n<p>The overall curation process of initially collecting free text and then annotator-revising it, was designed to combine the advantages of free-form text descriptions (which are fluent, high-quality and unhurriedly written, but also divergent and unfaithful) with annotator descriptions (which can be tailored to be faithful and to conform exactly to desired task requirements)</p>\n<h3 id=\"communicative-goal\">Communicative Goal</h3>\n<p>The speaker is required to produce a single, coherent English sentence that describes the highlighted cells in the given table, also using metadata and any other information from the table as applicable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"source-data\">Source Data</h3>\n<h4 id=\"initial-data-collection-and-normalization\">Initial Data Collection and Normalization</h4>\n<p>[More Information Needed]</p>\n<h4 id=\"who-are-the-source-language-producers\">Who are the source language producers?</h4>\n<p>The basic source language producers are Wikipedia authors and/or editors, since the annotation starts with the natural text description near the Wikipedia table.\nThe auxiliary source language producers are the annotators (two per example) who iteratively revise these descriptions to make them unambiguous and faithful to a subset of highlighted cells in the table.</p>\n<h3 id=\"annotations\">Annotations</h3>\n<h4 id=\"annotation-process\">Annotation process</h4>\n<p>The initial table-description pairs are tables from Wikipedia articles, extracted through heuristics such as Number Matching (tables and sentences that overlap with a non-date number of atleast 3 non-zero digits) (Refer to Section 4 of the paper for more)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Table Readability: Tables which are deemed non-readable (due to foreign language, poor formatting etc - a very small fraction of 0.5%) are removed from the dataset here.</li>\n<li>Cell Highlighting: The annotator highlights the cells of the table which support the description.</li>\n<li>Deletion: The annotator removes phrases in the description which are not supported by the highlighted cells</li>\n<li>Decontextualization: Descriptions may contain pronouns or other forms of anaphora, or other phenomena which depend on the overall article topic - these are fixed by replacement (e.g replacing pronouns with the entity, provided it occurs in the table).

This is Wikipedia article text as created upto that point in time by a chain of collaborative edits from Wikipedia authors.</li>\n<li>The initial description is revised by chain of two or more annotated revisions, to make it unambiguous and faithful to a set of highlighted table cells.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From their origin in 1), the descriptions may exhibit biases seen in Wikipedia text as mentioned above. From their revisions in 2), the descriptions may show biases originating from annotator-authored text, such as a preference for shorter descriptions since they're faster to write, or linguistic preferences influenced by the locations dominant in the annotator distribution.  (However, note that these are likely to be much reduced since the annotators here are merely revising rather than completely authoring. Moreover, each sentence goes through atleast two annotators, which acts as a check against the personal biases of a single annotator.)</p>\n<p>Naturally-occurring text is also known to suffer from other biases such as reporting bias <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=AzxEzvpdE3Wcy&#x26;noteId=vmR8qaby8fqxittps://labtomarket.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/wiki_gender_bias.pdf\">(Gordon and Van Durme, 2013)</a> - this also applies to this dataset via its origin from Wikipedia.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-known-limitations\">Other Known Limitations</h3>\n<p>The dataset is limited to topics that are present in Wikipedia, more specifically those topics that are present in articles which contain atleast one table\n<em>Sports</em> and <em>Countries</em> form 53.4% of the dataset.
