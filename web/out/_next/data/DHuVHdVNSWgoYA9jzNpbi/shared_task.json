{"pageProps":{"sharedTaskData":{"contentHtml":"<p>The GEM workshop features a two-part shared task: <strong>Modeling</strong> and <strong>Evaluation</strong>. In the modeling shared task, we ask participants to submit model outputs on the GEM tasks. For the evaluation shared task, participants will have access to outputs from the modeling shared task and computed evaluation metrics. The goal is to draw open-ended insights from the set of data, for example by finding shortcuts models have taken, or by exposing limitations in the metrics.</p>\n<p>Neither of the shared tasks will have a winner or loser and there will be no leaderboard that ranks the results. Instead, we see this as a shared quest toward understanding the limitations and opportunities of current NLG systems. We thus encourage widespread participation for systems of all shapes and sizes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modeling-shared-task\">Modeling Shared Task</h2>\n<p>To participate in the task, simply train a system on one or more of the included tasks (the more, the better!) and submit your validation and test outputs.</p>\n<p>We additionally ask every participant of this task to sign up for two hours of labeling time to produce gold-data for our human evaluation. More information on this is coming soon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data\">Data</h3>\n<p>The training and validation sets are available using the process described on <a href=\"\">this page</a>.</p>\n<p>All datasets are available through <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/\">Huggingface Datasets</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets\">Tensorflow Datasets</a>. Using Huggingface, you can load a dataset as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-python\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> datasets <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> load_dataset\ndata = load_dataset(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'GEM'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'dataset_identifier'</span>)</code></pre>\n<p>For more information on how to train models, see our <a href=\"/get_started\">tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submitting-outputs\">Submitting Outputs</h3>\n<p>Please format submissions in the following format</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"submission_name\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"An identifying name of your system\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"param_count\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">123</span>, # the number of parameters your system has.\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"description\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"An optional brief description of the system that will be shown on the website\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"citation\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"if applicable, link a paper here\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"tasks\"</span>:\n    {\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"dataset_identifier\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"language\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"en/vi/tu...\"</span>, # a two-letter denominator of the sets language.\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"values\"</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"output1\"</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"output2\"</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span>] # A list of system outputs\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, <code>dataset_identifier</code> is the identifier of the dataset followed by an identifier of the set the outputs were created from, for example <code>_val</code> or <code>_test</code>. That means, the CommonGEN validation set would have the identifier <code>commongen_val</code>.</p>\n<p>More information about our submission system is coming soon :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"evaluation-and-analysis-shared-task\">Evaluation and Analysis Shared Task</h2>\n<p>The evaluation and analysis shared task will start once the system outputs are submitted and we have run the automatic evaluation. Participants will be able to download the outputs and metrics and run their own analyses. The resulting findings can be submitted to our workshop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"important-dates\">Important Dates</h2>\n<p><strong>Modeling</strong></p>\n<p><code>February 2</code> Release of the Training Data</p>\n<p><code>March 29</code> Release of the Test Sets</p>\n<p><code>May 14</code> Modeling Submissions due</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>\n<p><code>March 29</code> Release of the Baseline Outputs</p>\n<p><code>May 17</code> Release of the Submission Outputs</p>\n<p><strong>System Descriptions and Analyses</strong></p>\n<p><code>June 11</code> System Descriptions and Analyses due</p>\n<p><code>June 25</code> Notification of Acceptance</p>\n<p><code>July 9</code> Camera-ready due</p>\n<p><code>August 5-6</code> Workshop Dates</p>\n","title":"GEM Shared Task at ACL 2021"}},"__N_SSG":true}
