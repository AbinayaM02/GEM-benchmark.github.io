The WebNLG data was originally created to promote the development of RDF verbalisers able to generate short text and to handle micro-planning (i.e., sentence segmentation and ordering, referring expression generation, aggregation); the goal of the task is to generate texts starting from 1 to 7 input triples which have entities in common (so the input is actually a connected Knowledge Graph). The dataset contains about 17,000 triple sets and 45,000 crowdsourced texts in English, and 7,000 triples sets and 19,000 crowdsourced texts in Russian. A challenging test set section with entities and/or properties that have not been seen at training time is available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-is-this-dataset-part-of-gem\">Why is this dataset part of GEM?</h3>\n<p>The WebNLG 2020 dataset is a large bi-lingual dataset with crowdsourced reference texts and a rather large variety of knowledge in the inputs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"languages\">Languages</h3>\n<p>English, Russian.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meta-information\">Meta Information</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dataset-curators\">Dataset Curators</h3>\n<p>It was compiled mostly by Anastasia Shimorina (Université de Lorraine / LORIA, France) and Thiago Castro Ferreira (Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil).</p>\n<h3 id=\"licensing-information\">Licensing Information</h3>\n<p>CC Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 4.0 International.</p>\n<h3 id=\"citation-information\">Citation Information</h3>\n<p>@InProceedings{gardent2017creating,\nauthor = \t\"Gardent, Claire\nand Shimorina, Anastasia\nand Narayan, Shashi\nand Perez-Beltrachini, Laura\",\ntitle = \t\"Creating Training Corpora for NLG Micro-Planners\",\nbooktitle = \t\"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)\",\nyear = \t\"2017\",\npublisher = \t\"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\npages = \t\"179--188\",\nlocation = \t\"Vancouver, Canada\",\ndoi = \t\"10.18653/v1/P17-1017\",\nurl = \t\"http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1017\"\n}</p>\n<p>@inproceedings{castro-ferreira20:bilin-bi-direc-webnl-shared,\ntitle={The 2020 Bilingual, Bi-Directional WebNLG+ Shared Task Overview and Evaluation Results (WebNLG+ 2020)},\nauthor={Castro Ferreira, Thiago and\nGardent, Claire and\nIlinykh, Nikolai and\nvan der Lee, Chris and\nMille, Simon and\nMoussallem, Diego and\nShimorina, Anastasia},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd WebNLG Workshop on Natural Language Generation from the Semantic Web (WebNLG+ 2020)},\npages = \"55--76\",\nyear = \t 2020,\naddress = \t {Dublin, Ireland (Virtual)},\npublisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}}</p>\n<h3 id=\"leaderboard\">Leaderboard</h3>\n<p>The dataset supports an active leaderboard, the best results are tracked here: <a href=\"https://beng.dice-research.org/gerbil/\">https://beng.dice-research.org/gerbil/</a>.

All the entries are wrapped in the tag <entries>. Each entry has five attributes: a DBpedia category, entry ID, shape, shape type, and triple set size.</p>\n<entry category=\"Food\" eid=\"Id65\" shape=\"(X (X) (X))\" shape_type=\"sibling\" size=\"2\">\nEach entry consists of three sections: <originaltripleset>, <modifiedtripleset>, and <lex>.\n<p>Original tripleset represents a set of triples as they were extracted from DBpedia. Each original triple is wrapped with the tag <otriple>.</p>\n<p>Modified tripleset represents a set of triples as they were presented to crowdworkers (for more details on modifications, see below). The order of triples in the benchmark is the same as the order in which triples were presented to the crowd. Each modified triple is wrapped with the tag <mtriple>.</p>\n<p>Lex (shortened for lexicalisation) represents a natural language text corresponding to triples. Each lexicalisation has two attributes: a comment, and a lexicalisation ID. By default, comments have the value good, except rare cases when they were manually marked as toFix. That was done during the corpus creation, when it was seen that a lexicalisation did not exactly match a triple set.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-statistics\">Data Statistics</h3>\n<p>All numbers below are for Train, Dev, Test respectively.</p>\n<p>English Triple sets: 13,211; 1,667; 1,779\nEnglish texts: 35,426; 4,464; 2,155\nProperties: 372; 290; 220</p>\n<p>Russian Triple sets: 5,573; 790; 1,102\nRussian texts: 14,239; 2,026; 2,780\nRussian: 226; 115; 192</p>\n<h2 id=\"dataset-creation\">Dataset Creation</h2>\n<h3 id=\"curation-rationale\">Curation Rationale</h3>\n<p>The WebNLG dataset aims at covering knowledge in different domains (\"categories\").

We describe below the most frequent changes that have been made. Full mapping information can be found here.</p>\n<p>1- Unclear properties were renamed.\n<otriple>Karnataka | west | Arabian_Sea</otriple>\n<mtriple>Karnataka | has to its west | Arabian_Sea</mtriple></p>\n<p>2- Properties whose semantics does not differ were merged to the same property to avoid redundancy in data.\n<otriple>Stuart_Parker_(footballer) | club | Chesterfield_F.C.</otriple>\n<otriple>Stuart_Parker_(footballer) | team | Chesterfield_F.C.</otriple></p>\n<p><mtriple>Stuart_Parker_(footballer) | club | Chesterfield_F.C.</mtriple></p>\n<p>3- Inexact subjects and objects were clarified.\n<otriple>1_Decembrie_1918_University,_Alba_Iulia | nickname | Uab</otriple>\n<mtriple>1_Decembrie_1918_University | nickname | Uab</mtriple>\nThis example demonstrates the motivation to have only the name of the university (1_Decembrie_1918_University), rather than its name together with its location (Alba_Iulia).</p>\n<p>4- Objects were replaced due to the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>incorrect DBpedia data (quite often stemming from the bad parsing of infoboxes);</li>\n</ul>\n<p><otriple>Ab_Klink | almaMater | Law</otriple>\n<mtriple>Ab_Klink | almaMater | Leiden_University</mtriple>\nThis incorrect original triple resulted from having Ab Klink who studied Law at the Leiden University.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>same data, but in different measurement units (e.g., feet/metres, Celsius/Fahrenheit, etc);</li>\n</ul>\n<p><otriple>320_South_Boston_Building | height | 400.0 (feet)</otriple>\n<otriple>320_South_Boston_Building | height | 121.92 (metres)</otriple>\n<mtriple>320_South_Boston_Building | height | 121.92 (metres)</mtriple></p>\n<ul>\n<li>same data, but in different formats (e.g., using double quotes, datatypes);</li>\n</ul>\n<p><otriple>Elliot_See | deathDate | \"1966-02-28\"^^xsd:date</otriple>\n<otriple>Elliot_See | deathDate | 1966-02-28</otriple>\n<mtriple>Elliot_See | deathDate | 1966-02-28</mtriple>\netc.</p>\n<p>The changes that have been made were sometimes quite drastic especially in the case of incorrect DBpedia data, so do not be surprised to see how original triples were converted to modified ones.</p>\n<p>An original tripleset and a modified tripleset usually represent a one-to-one mapping. However, there are cases with many-to-one mappings when several original triplesets are mapped to one modified tripleset.</p>\n<originaltripleset>\n    <otriple>Jens_Härtel | team | 1._FC_Magdeburg</otriple>\n</originaltripleset>\n<originaltripleset>\n    <otriple>Jens_Härtel | managerClub | 1._FC_Magdeburg</otriple>\n</originaltripleset>\n<modifiedtripleset>\n    <mtriple>Jens_Härtel | club | 1._FC_Magdeburg</mtriple>\n</modifiedtripleset>\nWe model the difference between original and modified triples as follows. They serve different purposes: the original triples — to link data to a knowledge base (DBpedia), whereas the modified triples — to ensure consistency and homogeneity throughout the data. To train models, the modified triples should be used.\n<h4 id=\"who-are-the-source-language-producers\">Who are the source language producers?</h4>\n<p>There are no source texts, all textual material was compiled during the annotation process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"annotations\">Annotations</h3>\n<h4 id=\"annotation-process\">Annotation process</h4>\n<p>Annotators were first asked to create sentences that verbalise single triples.
